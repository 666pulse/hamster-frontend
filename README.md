## About Hamster

Hamster aims to build the one-stop infrastructure developer toolkits for Web3.0. It defines itself as a development, operation, and maintenance (DevOps) service platform, providing a set of development tools and O&M tools to empower projects in Web3.0. This improves their coding and delivery speed, quality, and efficiency, as well as product reliability and safety.

With Hamster, developers or project teams can automate, standardize, and streamline the development, verification, and O&M stages of their blockchain projects. This includes multi-chain contract templates, contract/frontend code builds, security checks, contract deployments, and contract operation and maintenance.

In addition to its developer toolkits, Hamster offers RPC services and decentralized computing power network services when users choose to deploy their contracts via Hamster.

Simultaneously, the contract security check component within the developer toolkits is available separately for its to-C customers, allowing them to check their contracts and avoid potential security risks.
